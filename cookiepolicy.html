                    Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                    website. Cookies are
                    widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as
                    well as to provide

                    <br><br>
                    Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, __________) are called "first party cookies".
                    Cookies set by parties
                    other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
                    party features or
                    functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content
                    and analytics). The
                    parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the
                    website in question and
                    also when it visits certain other websites.

                        Why do we use cookies?

                    <br><br>
                    We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
                    reasons in order for
                    our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other
                    cookies also enable
                    us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online
                    Properties. Third parties
                    serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described
                    in more detail
                    below.
                    <br><br>
                    The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes
                    they perform are
                    described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific
                    Online Properties you
                    visit)

                    <strong>
                        How can I control cookies?

                    <br><br>
                    You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie
                    rights by setting your
                    preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
                    categories of cookies
                    you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
                    you with services.
                    <br><br>
                    The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose
                    to reject cookies,
                    you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may
                    be restricted. You
                    may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which
                    you can refuse
                    cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your
                    browser's help menu for
                    more information.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you

                        What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
                    </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
                    technologies from
                    time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
                    graphics files that
                    contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or
                    opened an e-mail
                    including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
                    within a website to
                    another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website
                    from an online
                    advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the
                    success of e-mail
                    marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
                    properly, and so declining
                    cookies will impair their functioning.
